This project tracks and visualizes Jupiter's position in the sky over several dates in March 2024 as part of a physics lab. Using data from [TheSkyLive](https://theskylive.com/jupiter-info), the code plots Jupiter's Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) for specific dates using Python libraries.

### Features:
- **Data Processing:** Converts RA and DEC data from observational format to angles suitable for plotting.

### Visualizations:
- Displays data in a table format.
- Generates a scatter plot of Jupiter’s position with date annotations.
- Creates a celestial map using the Mollweide projection to show Jupiter’s position on a spherical celestial sphere.

### Libraries Used:
- **Astropy:** For handling celestial coordinates and conversions.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating various visualizations, including scatter plots and celestial maps.

This project provides insights into the movement of Jupiter across the sky based on observational data from March 13 to March 25, 2024.
